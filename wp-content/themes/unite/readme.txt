Unite is a clean, modern and fully responsive WordPress wedding theme built using Bootstrap 3 which makes it optimized for tablets and mobile. It is a highly customizable theme with unlimited color variations that can be tweaked via simple yet powerful Theme Options.

Theme features fancy image slider, SEO friendly structure, logo support, social links and widgetized homepage.  This theme was built to be used for wedding related websites but can be tweaked to be used as any other image-centric blog such as travel.

Right after you activate Unite, you'll see message on top of your screen, asking you to install CPT Bootstrap Carousel (optional). Make sure you install and activate it if you want to setup image slider just like on theme demo.
