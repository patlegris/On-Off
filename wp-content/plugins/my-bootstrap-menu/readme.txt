== Description ==
My Boostrap Menu is a fully customizable plugin that applies the Bootstrap formatting classes to any Wordpress Navigation Menu. [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) provides responsive menus for phones, tablets and desktops.

The plugin allows the user to select a menu by name, or by selecting your theme's menu location. This gives extreme flexibility for theme developers, allowing multiple menus to be formatted as bootstrap menus- e.g. one fixed at the top and another at the bottom of the screen!

Works with all levels of Sub-menus! These were removed from Bootstrap in version 3, however we have included the original styles and each level will be correctly styled.

'My Boostrap Menu' is built on the ['My Plugin Settings'](http://www.codetoolbox.net/wordpress/wordpress-plugins/my-plugin-settings/) framework which creates simple and intuitive user interfaces for input forms; including media dialogues and the popup selection of [Bootstrap Glyphicons](http://glyphicons.com/).
